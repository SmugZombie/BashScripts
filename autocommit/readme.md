<strong>Script:</strong> autocommit.sh<br>
This is a simple script that can run on a cron to incrementally push to git repositories 
over time on a schedule instead of manually. This script also removes any previously 
removed local files to clean up the repo.<br><br>

<strong>Script:</strong> gitcommit.sh<br>
This is similar to above, but can be placed in your general github directory and can be used 
to commit any of your github repos with a simple prompt.
